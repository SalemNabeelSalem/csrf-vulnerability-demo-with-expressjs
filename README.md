# csrf-vulnerability-demo-with-expressjs
This demonstrates a CSRF vulnerability in the ExpressJS application. To fix this vulnerability, 
you can add CSRF protection to your forms by including a hidden input field with the CSRF token. 

This ensures that the request can only be made from a page that has access to the CSRF token, preventing attackers from forging requests.
